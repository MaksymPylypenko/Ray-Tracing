# Ray tracing 

This a recursive ray tracer implemented in C++ using object oriented style. List of completed features below...

## Reflection 
When the ray hits a reflective surface, it can bounce.

`Mirror room`
* Render time: 19 seconds
* Bounce limit: 5

`Mirror objects`
* Render time: 34 seconds
* Bounce limit: 5

## Refraction
When the ray hits a refractive surface like water or diamond, it refracts. 

`Image flip`

* Antialiasing: SSAA x4
* Render time: 64 sec
* Bounce limit: 5

There is also a special case where the ray would reflect instead of refracting. This is called a total internal reflection. This is what happens inside a pyramid

`Total internal reflection`
* Render time: 40 sec
* Bounce limit: 5

## Acceleration data structure
Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for meshes significantly improves the rendering time of very complex objects. I used the following [article](https://medium.com/@bromanz/another-view-on-the-classic-ray-aabb-intersection-algorithm-for-bvh-traversal-41125138b525) to improve the efficiency of my AABB intersection test.


`Utah teapot`
* Triangles count: 6320
* Render time: 317 seconds = 5.3 mins
* Render time (without BVH): approximately 317 * 10 / 60  = ~53 mins

## Textures

Procedural textures that generate a checkerboard pattern on the fly (e.g after a hit). 
The following [article](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/bonus/texture-mapping.html) was very helpful for this feature.

`Checkers`
* Render time: 19 seconds
* There is aliasing on the infinite planes. An effective solution might be to add a large bounding box for the whole scene.

There is also an ability to add custom uniform textures (note, that objects do not carry u,v coordinates).

`Custom texture`
* Render time: 19 seconds

## Transformations
Meshes can be translated, scaled and rotated

`Scaling + Rotation`
* Render time: 14 seconds

## Constructive solid geometry (CSG)
Objects can be subtracted from each other which may result in Subtraction / Intersection. Note that Union is automatically implemented in ray tracing.

`Blending mode`
* render time: 15 sec

## Area lighting
This type of light can create more realistic shadows, however there is a cost for that.. For instance, we need to send multiple samples to a random location on the lightâ€™s surface. Their average is then used to compute the final colour. I also used a simple heuristic to stop sending shadow rays after a long sequence of misses. 

* render time: 133 sec 
* max number of samples: 20
* longest sequence: 5

## Anti-Aliasing
Image quality can also be improved using Supersampling Anti-Aliasing (SSAA) x4. This is effectively rendering the scene at higher resolution and then compressing it into a desirable resolution.

## Ray Debug
If you click a pixel on the scene, you will receive detailed information about the ray's path. This was especially helpful for writing refractions and CSG operations.

```
CASTING A RAY

Triangle HIT from [Outside] @ RayLen = 2.172172,
Refracting AIR --> MATERIAL

Triangle HIT from [Inside] @ RayLen = 0.129709,
Total internal reflection ...

Triangle HIT from [Inside] @ RayLen = 0.214013,
Refracting MATERIAL --> AIR

Plane HIT from [Outside] @ RayLen = 4.186393,
```
