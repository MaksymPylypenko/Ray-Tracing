# Ray tracing 

This is a recursive implementation of a ray tracer in C++. List of completed features below...


## Reflection 
When the ray hits a reflective surface, it can bounce.

**Usage example** (add this for any object): 
``` json
{
	"type": "sphere",
	"radius": 1.0,
	"position": [ 0.0, -1.0, -10.0 ],
	"material": {
		"ambient": [ 0.2, 0.0, 0.0 ],
		"diffuse": [ 0.6, 0.0, 0.0 ],
		"specular": [ 0.7, 0.6, 0.6 ],
		"shininess": 25,
		"reflective": [ 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 ]
	}
}
```

**Walls are mirrors**
* Render time: 19 seconds
* Bounce limit: 5

**Objects are mirrors**
* Render time: 34 seconds
* Bounce limit: 5

## Refraction
When the ray hits a refractive surface like water or diamond, it refracts. 

**Usage example** (add this for any object): 
``` json
{
	"type": "sphere",
	"radius": 0.6,
	"position": [ 0.0, 0.0, -6.0 ],
	"material": {
		"transmissive": [ 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ],
		"refraction": 1.95
	}
}
```

**Minimalistic upside-down**

* Antialiasing: SSAA x4
* Render time: 64 sec
* Bounce limit: 5

There is also a special case where the ray would reflect instead of refracting. This is called a total internal reflection. You can observe this effect inside the following pyramid

**Total internal reflection**

* Render time: 40 sec
* Bounce limit: 5

## Acceleration data structure
Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for meshes significantly improved the rendering speed of very complex objects. I also used the following [article](https://medium.com/@bromanz/another-view-on-the-classic-ray-aabb-intersection-algorithm-for-bvh-traversal-41125138b525) to improve the efficiency of my AABB intersection test.

**You may use the following script to convert objects into a scene format**

```
srs/utility/obj2json.py
```

**Utah teapot**

* Triangles count: 6320
* Render time: 317 seconds = 5.3 mins
* Render time (without BVH): approximately 317 * 10 / 60  = ~53 mins

## Textures

There is an option to turn on *procedural textures* that generate a checkerboard pattern on the fly (e.g after a hit). The following [article](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/bonus/texture-mapping.html) was very helpful for this feature.

**Usage example** (add this for any object): 
``` json
"texture": {
	"procedural": "checkers",
	"scale": 12.0
}
```

**Checkers**

* Render time: 19 seconds
* There is aliasing on the infinite planes. An effective solution might be to add a large bounding box for the whole scene.

There is also an ability to add custom textures. Note, that these textures should be uniform, since objects do not carry u,v coordinates (this is calculated on demand).

**Usage example** (add this for any object): 
``` json
"texture": {
	"custom": "obsidian",
	"scale": 2600.0
}
```

**Custom texture**
* Render time: 19 seconds

## Transformations
Meshes can be translated, scaled and rotated (using arbitrary axis + angle).

**Usage example** (add this in the mesh description): 

``` json
"transform": {
	"new_origin": true,
	"scale": 0.5
	"rotation": {
		"axis": [ 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 ],             
		"angle": 90.0
	}             
}
```

**Scaling + Rotation**

* Render time: 14 seconds

## Constructive solid geometry (CSG)
Ray tracing allows us to perform bool operations on the ray. For instance, union is automatically implemented, while intersection is effectively subtract + subtract. 

**Usage example** (add this in the object description): 

``` json
"subtract" : true 
```

**Blending mode**

* render time: 15 sec

## Area lighting
This type of light can create more realistic shadows, however there is a cost for that.. For instance, we need to send multiple samples to a random location on the lightâ€™s surface. Their average is then used to compute the final colour. I also used a simple heuristic to stop sending shadow rays after a long sequence of misses. 


**Usage example** (add this as a light source): 

``` json
{
	"type": "area",
	"color": [ 1.0,1.0,0.85 ],
	"position": [-3.5, 0.5, -20 ],
	"dirU" : [0,1,0],
	"dirV" : [1,0,0],
	"distU" : 4.5,
	"distV" : 7.0,
}
```

**Cinema**

* render time: 133 sec 
* max number of samples: 20
* longest sequence: 5

## Anti-Aliasing
Image quality can also be improved using Supersampling Anti-Aliasing (SSAA) x4. This is effectively rendering the scene at higher resolution and then compressing it into a desirable resolution.

**Usage example** (add this in the camera description): 

``` json
"camera": {
   "field":      60,
   "background": [0, 0, 0.1],
   "antialiasing" : false
},
```

## Ray Debug
If you click a pixel on the scene, you will receive detailed information about the ray's path. This was especially helpful for writing refractions and CSG operations.

```
